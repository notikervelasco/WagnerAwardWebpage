                        Whether it's the satisfaction of receiving an A or the knowledge that hours of studying finally paid off,
                        pushing the limits of academic effort has always been one of my primary goals in navigating the landscape
                        of high school. Throughout my time in high school, I’ve focused on excelling academically while nurturing
                        my interests in computer science, business, and science.

                                journey. I consider myself non-typical in the world of sports, having played around eight 
                                different sports from the age of six to the present day. Throughout my life, I’ve continuously 
                                participated in one or more sports, and this has shaped me in ways I never expected. I’ve fallen 
                                in love with the competition, teamwork, and leadership that sports offer, and I’m excited to share 
                                my journey with you.

                                    and it has always held a special place in my heart. I’ve come to truly

                                    My second sport was gymnastics! Whether it was the bars, the foam pit, or 
                                    the runway, my memories of gymnastics were brief but fond. I can still do 
                                    a cartwheel and handstand—which still manages to impress some people! As 
                                    an individual sport, it taught me valuable skills like personal motivation, 
                                    resilience, and determination, and it’s an experience that will always stay 
                                    with me.

                                    the water ever since. As silly as it sounds, I’ve always felt like 
                                    Moana—drawn to the water—whether it’s the beach, a pool, or the ocean. 
                                    I'm currently a lifeguard for Milwaukee County, and I have my swimming

                                    My next sport was football. I played for 'The Saints,' a Catholic school

                                    I wasn’t particularly great during the two short years I played, the 
                                    experience will always stay with me. It taught me what it truly means to

                                    of my earliest high school memories is from cross country. I ran all four 
                                    years, eventually competing at state, earning the title of state academic 
                                    athlete, receiving a four-year varsity letter, and serving as team captain. 
                                    I’ve learned so much from this sport that it’s hard to capture it all in 
                                    one short paragraph—this chapter of my life was truly unforgettable.

                                    Last but not least, track and field. I’ve been running track since middle

                                    The challenge of long-distance races, the teammates I’ve met along the way,

                                Community and faith have always been central to my identity. Growing up attending a private 
                                Catholic school in Milwaukee, I fondly remember attending Friday Mass every week. The scent 
                                of the basilica, the sight of hundreds of people coming together to celebrate the same 
                                faith—it was a truly transformative experience. I can still picture the local bakers from 
                                whom my family would buy goods, the police officers who worked tirelessly to keep our streets 
                                safe, and the workers at the local park where we would go for recess. These experiences shaped 
                                my understanding of what it means to be part of a community and the role faith plays in 
                                bringing people together.

                                    offered full membership to the church as I came of age. This church holds special memories 
                                    for me. On weekends, it hosts a food pantry for those in need, and I was grateful for the 
                                    opportunity to volunteer there. Through this experience, I was able to form genuine 
                                    connections with my neighbors, the staff, and the broader community.

                                    As I got older, I was invited to spend part of my summer volunteering at Camp Anokijig in 
                                    Plymouth, Wisconsin. As a junior camp counselor, I was able to stay for free in exchange 
                                    for helping ensure the safety and well-being of kids ages 6 to 14. We were also responsible 
                                    for making sure they had a great time—which wasn’t hard at such a magical place. Located on 
                                    a lake, I got to teach sailing, lead water sports, and share my love for the water while 
                                    passing on skills to others. I spent over six weeks volunteering during the summer of 2022, 
                                    and I can confidently say it was one of my favorite volunteer experiences.

                                    Milwaukee, and my family and I have been proud members since around 2021. As a member, I not

                                    part of this community, especially alongside my family, has allowed me to experience Milwaukee 
                                    in a whole new way. Running through different neighborhoods has helped me truly see and 
                                    appreciate all that my community has to offer.

                            <p>
                                One of my earliest memories is of my dad telling me stories from his time stationed in Japan. 
                                He would describe the people he met, the culture he experienced, and the rich history of 
                                fighters and warriors that Japan is known for. On special occasions, he would even show me 
                                the sword he brought back as a souvenir. As a child, I didn’t fully understand the sacrifices 
                                he made to serve, protect, and honor our country. But as I’ve grown older, I’ve come to admire 
                                his dedication, and it has inspired me to honor my country in my own way.

                            Patriotism has always been an important part of who I am. I’ve had the honor of singing the national 
                            anthem at various events, each time feeling a deep sense of pride and respect for my country. I’ve 
                            also been taught the proper way to raise and fold the American flag—traditions that I take seriously 
                            and approach with great care. Inspired by my father, who served in the Army, I’ve considered following 
                            a similar path. I’m currently exploring the possibility of joining the Army Reserve as a way to serve 
                            my country while continuing to grow personally and professionally. For me, patriotism isn’t just a 
                            feeling—it’s something I strive to show through action and commitment.
